pingo-scripts
=============

Here some tools are found. They a designed to help our development.

If you use `vim` text editor, we sugest to the development team using the same `.vimrc` file. Previously we had some problems with tabs vs. 4spaces and traling white space. So, if everyone uses the same file, there will be no problems.

There is also a `purge_whitesapce.sh` script. It fixes the white space issue in all .py and .sh and  files of the project. So when adding new files that my not the ok about whitespace, run this script.
