Introduction
============

Pingo provides a uniform API to program devices like the Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone Black, pcDuino etc. just like the Python DBAPI provides an uniform API for database programming in Python.

The API is object-oriented but easy to use: a board is an instance of a ``Board`` subclass. Every board has a dictionary called ``pins`` which lists all GPIO pins on the board. Each pin is an instance of a ``Pin`` subclass with attributes that you can inspect to learn about its capabilities.

The name `Pingo`_ is a tribute to `Garoa Hacker Clube`_, where the project started (the words *pingo* and *garoa* are related in Portuguese). To our English-speaking friends we like to say that it means **"pin, go!"** -- the main purpose of this package.

Basic usage
-----------

``blink.py`` on an UDOO board:

.. code-block:: python

    import pingo
    from time import sleep

    board = pingo.udoo.Udoo()
    led_pin = board.pins[13]
    led_pin.set_mode(pingo.OUT)

    while True:
        led_pin.on()
        sleep(1)
        led_pin.off()
        sleep(1)

To do the same on a Arduino YÃºn, just change the line where the board is instantiated, and the pin numbers as needed:

.. code-block:: python

    import pingo
    from time import sleep

    board = pingo.arduino.yun.YunBridge()  # <---
    led_pin = board.pins[13]
    led_pin.set_mode(pingo.OUT)

    while True:
        led_pin.on()
        sleep(1)
        led_pin.off()
        sleep(1)


In the examples above, ``pingo.udoo`` ``pingo.arduino.yun`` are drivers, and the respective ``Udoo`` and ``YunBridge`` are classes implementing the ``pingo.board.Board`` interface.
